-- This version of the app is ready for use case midway into the league, as no teams or players will need to be created. 
-- Team and player creation functionality is unavailable. 

-- Next commit: 
        -- Team creation
        -- Player creation 
        -- Player deletion 
        -- Update Team

        -- Players will probably not need to be updated, as the only information they have on them is their name and gender and number, which is their own jersey. 
        -- Stats will never need to be deleted for the purposes of our basketball league 
        -- Same goes for teams

- So far, Ive created the barebones UI, which I probably have to update anyway. 
- For this commit, I have created the necessary GET and POST routes. 
- Because I am trying to launch this for productional testing by Sunday for the basketball game, only the GET and POST routes are necessary, as existing teams/players/stats won't need to be updated or deleted. 
- For the next commit, as part of my overall finished project for my portfolio, the PATCH and DELETE routes will need to be added for comprehensive functionality.

- So far, Ive created the barebones UI, which I probably have to update anyway. 
- For this commit, I have created the necessary GET and POST routes. 
- Because I am trying to launch this for productional testing by Sunday for the basketball game, only the GET and POST routes are necessary, as existing teams/players/stats won't need to be updated or deleted. 


- planning to add a GET Stats route for individual player stats. 
- need to create the UI for creating stats (hardest part) need to plan it carefully. 
    - 2 individual charts is probably necessary, just like the paper version we use at church. one for each team. 
    - i might be able to fit it in the screen if i make two tables one stacked on top of each other. because at most like 15 entries.
